# Wings of the Points

This is a chart to visually represent the transfer partnerships between rewards programs of US credit cards and airlines. 

Live Demo -> [https://siriolabs.github.io/Wings-of-the-Points/index.html](https://siriolabs.github.io/Wings-of-the-Points/index.html)


## Usage
* Move your mouse over the point name or airline name to highlight transfer relationships. 
* Move your mouse over any line connecting a point and a mile to see the transfer ratio. 
* The airlines are grouped by alliances. 
* You can use ctrl+F (or cmd+F) to quickly find an airline.

## Note

### SPG
The transfer ratio of SPG has already considered the 5,000 bonus Starpoints for every 20,000 you transfer at a time. 

### Marriott
The transfer ratio of Marriott requires a minimum of 70,000 Marriott Rewards points at a time (56,000 for UA). If you did not have enough Marriott Reward points, the actual transfer ratio would be lower.
