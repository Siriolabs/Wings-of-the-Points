# Wings of the Points

This is a chart to visually represent the transfer partnerships between rewards programs of US credit cards and airlines.

## Usage
* Move your mouse over the point name or airline name to highlight transfer relationships. 
* Move your mouse over any line connecting a point and a mile to see the transfer ratio. 
* The airlines are grouped by alliances. 
* You can use ctrl+F (or cmd+F) to quickly find an airline.

## Note

After merging with SPG in Aug 2018, you can now transfer Marriott points to airline miles at 3 to 1 ratio with most programs, and as a bonus, Marriott will add 15,000 points for every 60,000 points you transfer to airline miles. This 3:1.25 ratio is equivalent to the previous SPG program.
